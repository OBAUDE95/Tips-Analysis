## Summary:

This project focuses on analyzing tipping behavior using a dataset of restaurant bills and tips. The analysis aims to uncover key insights about how different factors—such as the time of day, day of the week, customer gender, and smoking status—affect tipping patterns.

### 1. Problem Statement

Restaurants rely on tips as a major component of employee income, but tipping behavior can vary significantly. The goal of this project is to analyze and understand what factors influence the amount of tips given. By exploring this data, businesses can make informed decisions about staffing, service timing, and customer engagement strategies.

### 2. Q&A

Although no explicit questions were provided, the analysis was designed to answer the following:

* What are the key descriptive statistics of the numerical variables?
* How are the categorical variables distributed?
* What are the relationships between total bill and tip amounts?
* How do tips vary by day of the week, time of day, gender, and smoker status?
* What is the relationship between party size and tip amount?

### 3. Data Analysis Key Findings

* **Data Cleaning:** One duplicate row was removed. No missing values or data type issues were found.
* **Descriptive Statistics:** 
  * Average total bill: \$19.81 (SD = \$8.91)  
  * Average tip: \$3.00 (SD = \$1.39)
* **Correlation Analysis:**
  * Total bill & tip: **strong positive correlation** (0.675)
  * Total bill & party size: **moderate positive** (0.598)
  * Tip & party size: **moderate positive** (0.488)
* **By Day:** Tips are higher on **Saturday and Sunday**.
* **By Time:** **Dinner** receives higher average tips than lunch.
* **By Gender:** **Male** customers give slightly higher tips on average.
* **By Smoker Status:** Very minimal difference between **smokers and non-smokers**.
* **Party Size and Tip:** Scatter plot shows a trend suggesting **larger parties tend to tip more**, possibly influenced by smoker status.

### 4. Insights or Next Steps

* **Investigate Outliers:** Examine extreme values in `total_bill` and `tip` for further patterns or data issues.
* **Explore Interactions:** Use statistical models or advanced visualizations to explore relationships like:
  * Does the day of the week affect the link between bill amount and tips?
  * Is the impact of party size on tips different for lunch vs dinner?
* **Model Building:** Consider building predictive models to forecast tip amounts based on available features.
